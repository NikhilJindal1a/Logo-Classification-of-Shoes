The Logo Classification of Shoes project focuses on developing a deep learning model to accurately classify shoe logos into three distinct categories: Nike, Adidas, and Converse. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, the model processes images of shoe logos to identify the brand. Data augmentation techniques like rotation and zoom were applied to enhance the modelâ€™s performance and robustness. The project aims to improve logo recognition, making it highly applicable for e-commerce and retail sectors where brand differentiation is critical. The result is a reliable and efficient system for brand identification.
